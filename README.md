# ISA SportHub

Welcome to the ISA SportHub repo! This project is currently a monorepo with the backend and frontend code coexisting in the same place.

All Frontend code is Next.js in the [sport-hub](/sport-hub) directory and all Backend code is in the [sport-hub-backend]() directory.

Join the discord channel to get involved with development, ask questions, and keep track of the latest changes in the `github-webhook` channel.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the individual README files for both Frontend and Backend to get started with development.
